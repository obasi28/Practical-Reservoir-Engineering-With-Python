    "Production from wells typically declines over time due to the natural depletion of reservoir pressure and changing reservoir dynamics. Decline Curve Analysis is an empirical method that uses mathematical models to represent this decline. The three primary decline models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential Decline**\n",
    "   - **Concept:** Assumes that the production rate declines at a constant percentage rate.\n",
    "   - **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     q(t) = q_i e^{-d_i t}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - \\(q(t)\\) is the production rate at time \\(t\\),\n",
    "     - \\(q_i\\) is the initial production rate,\n",
    "     - \\(d_i\\) is the constant decline rate.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** This model is often applicable to wells in the early life stages or in reservoirs where the pressure decline is relatively uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Harmonic Decline**\n",
    "   - **Concept:** Assumes that the decline rate decreases over time.\n",
    "   - **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     q(t) = \\frac{q_i}{1 + d_i t}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     - The decline rate here is inversely proportional to time.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** This model can better capture the slowing decline of production in some reservoirs compared to the exponential model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperbolic Decline**\n",
    "   - **Concept:** Offers additional flexibility by introducing a hyperbolic exponent that controls the curvature of the decline.\n",
    "   - **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     q(t) = \\frac{q_i}{\\left(1 + b\\,d_i\\,t\\right)^{1/b}}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - \\(b\\) is the hyperbolic exponent.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** When \\(b = 0\\), the model converges to the exponential form. Values of \\(b\\) between 0 and 1 allow the model to represent various declining behaviors often observed in mature reservoirs.\n",

    "1. Reading the forecast period (in years) from user input.\n",
    "2. Creating a time array for the forecast period (in months).\n",
    "3. Calculating the forecasted production using the selected decline model.\n",
    "4. Plotting both historical data and forecasted production on the same graph for visual comparison.\n",

    "Decline Curve Analysis is a vital tool in petroleum engineering used to estimate recoverable reserves and forecast future production rates. This notebook demonstrates the implementation of exponential, harmonic, and hyperbolic decline models. Through detailed explanations and step-by-step code walkthroughs, new graduates and early career petroleum engineers can gain both a theoretical understanding and practical insights into applying DCA for reservoir management.\n",
